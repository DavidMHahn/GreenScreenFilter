# GreenScreenFilter
This is the Green Screen Filter that was created by me for the Coursera MOOC class- Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML and CSS
by Duke University.<br>
This program allows you to use Codepen.io to upload a green screen image and a separate background image and make a composite of the two.<br>

You can go into the program and change the green value threshold for refining how sensitive the filter will be concerning the green color value of your green screen image.<br>
Here is a link to the Codepen.io files: <a href="https://codepen.io/mrhahnda/pen/JJELNN">Green Screen Filter</a>
