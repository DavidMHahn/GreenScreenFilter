# GreenScreenFilter
This is the Green Screen Filter that was created by me for the Coursera MOOC class- Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML and CSS
by Duke University.
This program allows you to use Codepen.io to upload a green screen image and a separate background image and make a composite of the two. 
You can go into the program and change the green value threshold for refining how sensitive the filter will be concerning the green color value of your green screen image.
Here is a link to the Codepen.io files: <a href="https://codepen.io/mrhahnda/pen/JJELNN>Green Screen Filter</a>
